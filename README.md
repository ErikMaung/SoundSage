MERN Stack music-inspired blogsite.

## How to Run Project Locally:
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/ethanbresk/SoundSage.git` in your terminal while in the directory where you would like to store a copy of the project.
2. Enter the `./SoundSage/Frontend` project subdirectory to begin running the client locally.
3. Run `npm install` to acquire all of the node module dependencies that were not copied over due to its listing in our `.gitignore` document.
4. Run `npm start` (and append `-- --port [PORTNUMBER]` to specify a PORTNUMBER if desired).
5. Open another terminal window.
6. In the second terminal window, enter the `./SoundSage/Backend` subdirectory, `npm install`, and `npm start`. Now, you should see all blogposts on the homepage.
7. Login using your Spotify (may require whitelisting), check out the music blogs, and create and post your own. Enjoy!
